% Introduce what we are trying to do: explore different methods for
% building the index, and comparing against gold. Foreshadow the
% methods: naive/pedagogy-inclusive/external-knowledge.

% List whatever is common to the three experiments: stop word removal,
% method used for stemming...

We implemented different keyword extraction algorithms and measured how closely they agreed with the gold index formed by human annotators.

% Insert something about the metric once we have it really nailed down.

For each experiment we apply the Porter stemming algorithm to each word in the document and each word in a keyphrase, so there will be a match between phrases if all of the individual stemmed tokens match. In experiments using n-grams as candidate phrases, stopwords were removed from the document before the n-grams were formed, using the stopword list used in the SMART system \cite{salton1971smart}. 
% In experiments using part-of-speech tagging, the Stanford Log-Linear POS tagger was used \cite{toutanova2003feature}.
