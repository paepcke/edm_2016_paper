\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}

% Introduce what we are trying to do: explore different methods for
% building the index, and comparing against gold. Foreshadow the
% methods: naive/pedagogy-inclusive/external-knowledge.

% List whatever is common to the three experiments: stop word removal,
% method used for stemming...

We implemented different keyword extraction algorithms and measured
how closely they agreed with the gold index derived from the work of
our human indexers.

% Insert something about the metric once we have it really nailed down.

For each experiment we applied the Porter stemming algorithm to each
word in the document and each word in phrases destined for the index.
Phrases therefore matched if all of the individual stemmed tokens
matched. In experiments using n-grams as candidate phrases, stopwords
were removed from the document before the n-grams were formed, using
the stopword list of the SMART system \cite{salton1971smart}.

% In experiments using part-of-speech tagging, the Stanford Log-Linear POS tagger was used \cite{toutanova2003feature}.

The following subsections introduce the algorithm (families) we
applied to the lecture transcripts.
