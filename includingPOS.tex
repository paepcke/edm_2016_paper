\subsection{Leveraging Linguistic Information}

% Do we have any experiments that do take the positions of terms in the
% sequence of videos into account? Such an experiment would nicely tell
% a story from naive TF/IDF to including pedagogy to including external
% wikipedia.
We measured an
algorithm that first runs a part-of-speech tagger over the lecture
transcripts, and then selected only phrases that consist of a number of adjectives followed by one or more nouns. For
example, ``equality condition'' or ``XML data'' were both included in
the candidate set. We then ran TF-IDF over this reduced set.
